# Web 2.0

- Computing Paradigm shifts from 3 tiers to microservices, containers, swarms and so son 
- We are able to build distributed apps, but the centralization still persists
- We need to talk about new architectural models

[Generative AI and Blockchain](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive) 

Gen AI and BCT

One of the key challenges with AI-generated content is ownership and copyright protection. By integrating blockchain technology into
generative AI, it can transparently track ownership of content. Content can be timestamped, encrypted, and stored as a unique digital asset on the blockchain.

The convergence of generative AI and blockchain offers exciting possibilities for industries such as entertainment, gaming, advertising, and more.
